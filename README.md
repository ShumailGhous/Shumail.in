# Langton's Ant Simulation

This project provides an interactive simulation of **Langton's Ant** with customizable rules and additional features. Users can choose different ant behaviors, interact with the grid to set initial states, and speed up the simulation with a fast-forward option.

---

## Features

- **Multiple Ant Behaviors**: Choose between Langton's Ant, Turk's Ant, and a custom rule set.
- **Interactive Grid Editing**: Click on the grid to toggle cell colors and set custom initial states.
- **Speed Boost on Pause**: Fast-forward the simulation for a specified number of steps while paused.
- **Customizable Grid Size**: The grid can be resized to suit the user's preference.
- **Colorful Ants**: Each ant has a unique color for better visualization.
- **Live Simulation**: Watch the ant move and evolve the grid in real-time.

---

## Controls

- **Ant Behavior**: Select from **Langton's Ant**, **Turk's Ant**, or **Custom Rules**.
- **Grid Interaction**: Click on any cell in the grid to toggle between black and white.
- **Pause/Resume**: Click the "Pause" button to pause or resume the simulation.
- **Fast Forward**: Specify how many steps to simulate while paused using the input field and press the "Fast Forward" button.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For structure and layout.
- **CSS3**: For styling.
- **JavaScript**: For the logic and interactivity.

---

## Future Enhancements

- **Pattern Export**: Save the current grid state as a file to reload later.
- **Multiple Ants**: Simulate multiple ants moving at the same time with different behaviors.
- **Additional Rule Variants**: Add more ant behavior rule sets for variety.
