  <div class="section">Umm, Hey?</div>
  <div class="section">Are you supposed to be here? I don't think so.</div>
  <div class="section">What are you doing here?</div>
  <div class="section">Who sent you here?</div>
  <div class="section">Wait, you really decided to scroll all the way down here? What are you doing with your life?</div>
  <div class="section">Oh, you think this is some kind of treasure hunt? Spoiler alert: It's not.</div>
  <div class="section">I hope you didn’t think there was some life-changing revelation at the bottom of this page.</div>
  <div class="section">
    The internet is a vast ocean of knowledge and resources yet you came here on this obscure unknown website with a domain name of no significant value in any language. Really? Is this the best you could find?
    You’ve now discovered an obscure website that barely anyone knows about, with a domain name that’s, quite frankly, not even worth mentioning in any dictionary, ever. 
    But, hey, welcome to the void. The internet has truly outdone itself this time.
  </div>
  <div class="section">Are you a bot? If yes, Close this tab right now.</div>
  <div class="section">So you are not a bot? You really are a human. How surprising.</div>
  <div class="section">How strange, Now would you please tell me your purpose of this visit? Was there a secret mission you came for?</div>
  <div class="section">Are you still not tired of scrolling? Is this really what you came here for?</div>
  <div class="section">Are you a bot? Don’t even try to lie to me, I know a bot when I see one. Go ahead, close this tab if you are one.</div>
  <div class="section">So you’re telling me, you’re actually a human? Wow. The audacity.</div>
  <div class="section">You know what’s the most fascinating thing here? Your decision to keep scrolling. Honestly, I’m not sure if I should be impressed or concerned.</div>
  <div class="section">Still not tired of scrolling? Are you absolutely certain you’re not a robot sent to test human patience?</div>
  <div class="section">
    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ">Click here to scroll all the way down to bottom. (I dare you!)</a>
    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ">Click here if you’re brave enough to scroll all the way to the bottom... I dare you!</a>
  </div>
  <div class="section">Did you click it? Oh no, you fell for it!</div>
  <div class="section">You don't like shortcuts? Okay, You stubborn little child. What do you even expect to find at the bottom of this mess?</div>
  <div class="section">Let's end this now, once and for all. Or will you keep scrolling forever?</div>
  <div class="section">Did you actually click it? Ah, the clickbait worked on you. What a surprise.</div>
  <div class="section">You seriously don’t like shortcuts, do you? Fine, be stubborn. Let’s see how long you can scroll for.</div>
  <div class="section">What exactly are you hoping to find here, by the way? A golden nugget of wisdom? A life-changing insight? Spoiler: You won’t find any of that.</div>
  <div class="section">How much longer are you planning on scrolling? I’m almost out of sarcastic comments at this point, but here we go...</div>
  <div class="section">
    I mean, at this point, you’ve scrolled so far, you’ve probably passed a couple of existential crises. Still going, huh? Impressive. Or worrying. Depends on how you look at it.
  </div>
  <div class="section">Okay, Okay. Let’s wrap this up before you scroll into oblivion and forget what you were even looking for.</div>
  <div class="final-section">
    Congratulations, You successfully wasted your life scrolling.<br>
    You scrolled so far that now you should probably rethink your life choices.<br>
    But hey, good job. You've mastered the art of scrolling endlessly.<br>
    In total, you’ve scrolled so much that you're probably in some kind of alternate dimension by now. I bet you feel like a champion, huh?
  </div>
  <div class="section">
    Made with love by human.<br>
    <a href="#top">Click here to scroll to the top. (Or don't. I'm not your boss.)</a>
    Made with love (and a bit of regret) by a human.<br>
    <a href="#top">Click here if you’re done wasting your time and want to scroll back to the top. Or don’t. Whatever.</a>
