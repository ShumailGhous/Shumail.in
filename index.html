  <div class="section">Hmm, what are you doing here?</div>
  <div class="section">Are you lost? Or just curious?</div>
  <div class="section">You’ve scrolled so far. What are you hoping to find?</div>
  <div class="section">Is this some kind of treasure hunt for you?</div>
  <div class="section">You really thought there would be something here, didn’t you?</div>
  <div class="section">By now, you must be wondering, “Why am I still scrolling?”</div>
  <div class="section">Here’s a fun fact: You’re not the first to scroll this far.</div>
  <div class="section">It’s okay to give up, you know. No one’s judging.</div>
  <div class="section">But hey, you’ve made it this far. Impressive? Maybe. A little strange? Definitely.</div>
  <div class="section">Let me guess, you’re thinking there must be a secret waiting at the end. Spoiler: There isn’t.</div>
  <div class="section">I should’ve warned you earlier: This is a never-ending scroll.</div>
  <div class="section">Are you still scrolling? Honestly, you’re surprising me.</div>
  <div class="section">If you’re still here, you must be very determined.</div>
  <div class="section">But seriously, do you think there’s some life-changing revelation down here?</div>
  <div class="section">
    <a href="https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ">Click here for a surprise (or not)</a>
  </div>
  <div class="section">Did you click it? Gotcha!</div>
  <div class="section">So, no shortcut? Fine, you want to do this the hard way?</div>
  <div class="section">Let’s be real, you’re probably scrolling just to prove you can.</div>
  <div class="section">Now that you’re down here, what’s your next move? Keep scrolling?</div>
  <div class="final-section">
    Congratulations! You've just spent way too much time scrolling. What did you achieve? Nothing really, but hey, you got to the end!
  </div>
  <div class="section">
    Made with love by human.<br>
    <a href="#top">Click here to scroll back up, or don’t. It’s your call.</a>
