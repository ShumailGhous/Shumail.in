  <div class="section">Hmm, what are you doing here?</div>
  <div class="section">Are you lost? Or just curious?</div>
  <div class="section">You‚Äôve scrolled so far. What are you hoping to find?</div>
  <div class="section">Is this some kind of treasure hunt for you?</div>
  <div class="section">You really thought there would be something here, didn‚Äôt you?</div>
  <div class="section">By now, you must be wondering, ‚ÄúWhy am I still scrolling?‚Äù</div>
  <div class="section">Here‚Äôs a fun fact: You‚Äôre not the first to scroll this far.</div>
  <div class="section">It‚Äôs okay to give up, you know. No one‚Äôs judging.</div>
  <div class="section">But hey, you‚Äôve made it this far. Impressive? Maybe. A little strange? Definitely.</div>
  <div class="section">Let me guess, you‚Äôre thinking there must be a secret waiting at the end. Spoiler: There isn‚Äôt.</div>
  <div class="section">I should‚Äôve warned you earlier: This is a never-ending scroll.</div>
  <div class="section">Are you still scrolling? Honestly, you‚Äôre surprising me.</div>
  <div class="section">If you‚Äôre still here, you must be very determined.</div>
  <div class="section">But seriously, do you think there‚Äôs some life-changing revelation down here?</div>
  <div class="section"><a href="https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ">Click here for a surprise (or not)</a></div>
  <div class="section">Did you click it? Gotcha!</div>
  <div class="section">So, no shortcut? Fine, you want to do this the hard way?</div>
  <div class="section">Let‚Äôs be real, you‚Äôre probably scrolling just to prove you can.</div>
  <div class="section">Now that you‚Äôre down here, what‚Äôs your next move? Keep scrolling?</div>
  <div class="section">I respect your dedication, but do you even remember why you started?</div>
  <div class="section">At this point, you‚Äôve scrolled more than you‚Äôve exercised all year.</div>
  <div class="section">Tell me, was it worth it?</div>
  <div class="section">This page isn‚Äôt going to suddenly reveal the meaning of life.</div>
  <div class="section">But hey, if wasting time is an art, consider yourself a masterpiece.</div>
  <div class="section">You‚Äôve scrolled so much, I should charge you rent.</div>
  <div class="section">Are you sure you‚Äôre not stuck in an infinite loop?</div>
  <div class="section">You must really enjoy scrolling.</div>
  <div class="section">Do you feel accomplished? Because you should. Kind of.</div>
  <div class="section">I can‚Äôt believe you‚Äôre still here.</div>
  <div class="section">Okay, last warning. There‚Äôs nothing down here.</div>
  <div class="section">Fine. Scroll to the very end. I dare you.</div>
  
  <div class="final-section">
    Congratulations! You've just reached the end. Or have you? The choice is yours.<br>
    All I know is that you wasted <span id="time-spent"></span> seconds and scrolled <span id="distance-scrolled"></span> meters.<br>
    And guess what? You even burnt <span id="calories-burnt"></span> calories in doing so.<br>
    Isn‚Äôt this the most movement you‚Äôve done all year? Be honest.
