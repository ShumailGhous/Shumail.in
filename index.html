  <div class="section">Hmm, what are you doing here?</div>
  <div class="section">Are you lost? Or just curious?</div>
  <div class="section">You’ve scrolled so far. What are you hoping to find?</div>
  <div class="section">Is this some kind of treasure hunt for you?</div>
  <div class="section">You really thought there would be something here, didn’t you?</div>
  <div class="section">By now, you must be wondering, “Why am I still scrolling?”</div>
  <div class="section">Here’s a fun fact: You’re not the first to scroll this far.</div>
  <div class="section">It’s okay to give up, you know. No one’s judging.</div>
  <div class="section">But hey, you’ve made it this far. Impressive? Maybe. A little strange? Definitely.</div>
  <div class="section">Let me guess, you’re thinking there must be a secret waiting at the end. Spoiler: There isn’t.</div>
  <div class="section">I should’ve warned you earlier: This is a never-ending scroll.</div>
  <div class="section">Are you still scrolling? Honestly, you’re surprising me.</div>
  <div class="section">If you’re still here, you must be very determined.</div>
  <div class="section">But seriously, do you think there’s some life-changing revelation down here?</div>
  <div class="section"><a href="https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ">Click here for a surprise (or not)</a></div>
  <div class="section">Did you click it? Gotcha!</div>
  <div class="section">So, no shortcut? Fine, you want to do this the hard way?</div>
  <div class="section">Let’s be real, you’re probably scrolling just to prove you can.</div>
  <div class="section">Now that you’re down here, what’s your next move? Keep scrolling?</div>
  <div class="section">I respect your dedication, but do you even remember why you started?</div>
  <div class="section">At this point, you’ve scrolled more than you’ve exercised all year.</div>
  <div class="section">Tell me, was it worth it?</div>
  <div class="section">This page isn’t going to suddenly reveal the meaning of life.</div>
  <div class="section">But hey, if wasting time is an art, consider yourself a masterpiece.</div>
  <div class="section">You’ve scrolled so much, I should charge you rent.</div>
  <div class="section">Are you sure you’re not stuck in an infinite loop?</div>
  <div class="section">You must really enjoy scrolling.</div>
  <div class="section">Doomscrolling Instagram Reels wasn’t enough, huh? Had to test your scrolling endurance here too?</div>
  <div class="section">At least this page isn’t feeding you random content. Just existential dread. Enjoy.</div>
  <div class="section">Do you feel accomplished? Because you should. Kind of.</div>
  <div class="section">I can’t believe you’re still here.</div>
  <div class="section">Okay, last warning. There’s nothing down here.</div>
  <div class="section">Fine. Scroll to the very end. I dare you.</div>
  
  <div class="final-section">
    Congratulations! You've just reached the end. Or have you? The choice is yours.<br>
    But let’s be real—you scrolled all this way, and for what? Satisfaction? A reward? <br>
    Well, here’s your prize: a moment of self-awareness. Maybe it's time to touch some grass. 🌱
